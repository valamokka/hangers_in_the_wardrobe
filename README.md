**Wardrobe**


This smart wardrobes and smart hangers could make a lot of people-'s life easier. 
This is the prototyping phase when I created some basic functionality for this revolutionary furniture. 
It shouldn't have a graphical interface for the time being only a simple console version. 
Just to see the different wardrobe scenarios.

Functionalities:

1. There are different clothes that can be placed on hangers.
   - shirt
   - blouse
   - trousers
   - skirt
    
2. There are different types of hangers which can store different clothes in different ways.
    - ShirtHanger can accommodate only those clothes that can be worn on the upper body (shirts and blouses).
    - PantHanger can accommodate one piece of an upper clothes plus one piece of trousers or skirts.
   
3. Wardrobe is a storage for clothes but there are some rules how these clothes can be placed in it.
   - maximum 120 hangers can be stored in a wardrobe
   - A piece of clothing can only be hanged in the wardrobe if it's on a hanger already, 
     you can't hang a shirt directly into the wardrobe.
     
   - Clothes can be taken out of the wardrobe by their unique identifier
